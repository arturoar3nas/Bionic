**PCA9685**

16-channel,  12-bit  PWM  Fm+  I2C-bus  LED  controller

https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCA9685.pdf

PCA9685  Highlights  from  datasheet

-  16  individually  controlled  channels

-  12bit  (4096  steps)  registers  both  for  on  and  off  time

-  1MHz  fast  I2C  bus  interface  with  30mA  high  drive  capability  on  SDA  output  for  driving  high  capacitive  buses

-  24  Hz  to  1526  Hz  PWM  frequency  for  all  LEDs  with  internal  25MHz  oscillator

-  Operating  power  supply  voltage  range  of  2.3  V  to  5.5  V

-  Six  hardware  address  pins  allow  up  to  62  devices  on  the  same  bus
